## Phase 3 of COS 301 mini-project. 

# Facial Recognition- Ocean(Group 12)  
This project mainly focuses on designing next-gen ATM's for FNB as part of a assignment for COS 301.
We are tasked with implementing the **Facial Recognition** subsystem which involves receiving an image from the **Authentication** subsystem and matching that image to a user id on our database. We then send back the user id or an exception to **Authentication** subsystem. We also have to maintain or database with data from the **Client Information System**.

We plan on implementing these features in **Python** and hosting our services via an API.
